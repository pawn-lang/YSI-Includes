					Y Sever Includes - Bit Core
					===========================
Description:
	Provides functions for bit manipulation and bit arrays greater than 32bits.
	The arrays are usually bigger than required due to cell boundaries but this
	shouldn't cause a major problem (bit tests on the 101st bit of a 100 bit
	array won't return 0 for out of bounds, but the 129th will).
	
	Note that y_commands has a few optimisations which bypass the code in here
	so any modifications to bit array layouts will need to be reflected there.
