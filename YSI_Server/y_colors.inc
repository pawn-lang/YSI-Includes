					 y_colours - X11 colours!
					==========================
Description:
	This holds the colour information that used to be part of the text system
	but which is far more useful than just for text.  This now supports the full
	set of X11 colours, both by name and by definition.  You can also define
	your own if you so choose (up to 32 - should be enough given that this
	includes the X11 colours).
