 *     This library uses the enhanced <em>pawndoc.xsl</em> from
 *     <a href="https://github.com/pawn-lang/pawndoc">pawn-lang/pawndoc</a>.
 *     This XSL has features such as library and markdown support, and will not
 *     render this message when used.
 *   </summary>
 *   <remarks>
 *     This holds the colour information that used to be part of the text system
 *     but which is far more useful than just for text.  This now supports the full
 *     set of X11 colours, both by name and by definition.  You can also define
 *     your own if you so choose (up to 32 - should be enough given that this
 *     includes the X11 colours).
 *   </remarks>
