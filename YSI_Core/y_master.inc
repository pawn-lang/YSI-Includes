 *     This library uses the enhanced <em>pawndoc.xsl</em> from
 *     <a href="https://github.com/pawn-lang/pawndoc">pawn-lang/pawndoc</a>.
 *     This XSL has features such as library and markdown support, and will not
 *     render this message when used.
 *   </summary>
 *   <remarks>
 *     <p>
 *     Handles distribution of control of code segments across all running scripts
 *     with YSI to avoid conflicts of checkpoint streamers etc and allow features
 *     like "/commands" displaying all commands on the server.
 *     </p>
 *     
 *     <p>
 *     Now fully autonomous - to use the master system simply define which one you
 *     want and include the script:
 *     
 *     <code>
 *       #define MASTER 14 <br />
 *       #include "Master"
 *     </code>
 *     
 *     That will make the current script attempt to make itself the main master -
 *     you don't need ANY other code for initialisation anywhere (which took a
 *     while to figure out)...
 *     </p>
 *     
 *     <p>
 *     This is now over 2000 lines of repetitive and complex macros!
