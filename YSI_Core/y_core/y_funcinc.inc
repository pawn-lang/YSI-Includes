 *     This library uses the enhanced <em>pawndoc.xsl</em> from
 *     <a href="https://github.com/pawn-lang/pawndoc">pawn-lang/pawndoc</a>.
 *     This XSL has features such as library and markdown support, and will not
 *     render this message when used.
 *   </summary>
 *   <remarks>
 *     Calls functions which are used in SYSREQ.C calls before they are used.
 *     The old compiler crashes if the functions are not used in an included
 *     function before being used in a SYSREQ.C call as the function is not in
 *     the native functions table.
