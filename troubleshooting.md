# Troubleshooting

As a general rule, each library has its own documentation on issues found in those libraries.  These are listed in the FAQ sections, so refer to those files for more help.

If you have a question about how to use a part of YSI, and it isn't covered by any of the documentation, try posting on the [forums](http://form.sa-mp.com/) or in [discord](https://discord.gg/2nFPkaZ).

If you have found a bug in YSI itself, please post an issue on [github](https://github.com/pawn-lang/YSI-Includes/issues), and make it [MCV](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) (but DO use tabs - ignore their instructions about that).
